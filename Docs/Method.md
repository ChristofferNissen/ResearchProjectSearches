# Method

Our method follows these steps:

1) Select initial keywords from project description

2) Automated script is run to find all combinations until max 3 keywords are combined. The reason for this is to gain a quick overview of the landscape, based on our keywords.

3) Process combined keyword search results

3a) Results under 10 hits: 
    Look at titles and check if these makes sense for us
    Gather venues for each query under 10 hits to see if we are hitting certain journals. 

3b) Results over 10 hits:
    Prioritize the combined queries after what makes most sense (its cartesian product after all, not all will be equally important)
    
    Look into most prioritized queries, and based on the articles, extract new keywords to be used in a search. 

    Further refine the search strings to reduce the number of hits, if this category is valueable to us. 

4) Refine keywords list based on findings from 3, and repeat from step 2


5) After some iterations of the above, select a limited number of prioritized search strings and refined these until satisfied, and then start reading articles.
