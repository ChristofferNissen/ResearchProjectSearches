# Research Protocol

This document describes the applied research protocol.

## Tor

Scholarly utilizes the Tor Network to scrape Google Scholar to find articles for our research protocol. 

## Keyword

The 'keyword' folder contains our search-term lists, with each file being an iteration of the search terms. The rationale for each keyword file can be found below:

Initial.txt
```
This is our initial keyword file. Keywords have been lifted verbatum from our project description and our research questions.
```

2.txt
```

The most noteworthy changes are 
Replace:
    Continious Integration
    Continious Delivery
    Continious Software Engineering
    FDA Requirement

With: 
    Continious
    FDA Requirements


Why?
To reduce hits on Continious Software Engineering, CI and CD specifically, as we are not researching what DevOps is and its elements. 

FDA requirements are often mentioned in plural, so we wanted to try out this keyword aswell.

Difference compared to initial.txt:

```
