     Title Using residence time distributions (RTDs) to address the traceability of raw materials in continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing
     Author ['W Engisch', 'F Muzzio']
     Venue Journal of pharmaceutical innovation
     Year 2016
     Abstract Continuous processing in pharmaceutical manufacturing is a relatively new approach that has generated significant attention. While it has been used for decades in other industries, showing significant advantages, the pharmaceutical industry has been slow in its adoption

     Title Fuzzy traceability: a process simulation derived extension of the traceability concept in continuous food processing
     Author ['T Skoglund', 'P Dejmek']
     Venue Food and bioproducts processing
     Year 2007
     Abstract Liquid food production often involves continuous processing. This leads to problems in traceability systems due to mixing zones and therefore indistinct batch identities causing difficulties with regard to withdrawals or recalls. This article outlines the possible use of the

     Title Methods for traceability in continuous processes–Experience from an iron ore refinement process
     Author ['B Kvarnström', 'P Oghazi']
     Venue Minerals engineering
     Year 2008
     Abstract Every production process is exposed to disturbances leading to production of defective products. The disturbances are seldom immediately discovered, and need to be traced afterwards. Traceability, or the ability to follow a product through the process, is therefore

     Title Continuous and automated evolution of architecture-to-implementation traceability links
     Author ['LGP Murta', 'A van der Hoek', 'CML Werner']
     Venue Automated Software …
     Year 2008
     Abstract A traditional obstacle in the use of multiple representations is the need to maintain traceability among the representations in the face of evolution. The introduction of software architecture, and architecture-based development, has brought this need to architectural

     Author ['D Ståhl', 'K Hallén', 'J Bosch']
     Venue Empirical Software Engineering
     Year 2017
     Abstract The importance of traceability in software development has long been recognized, not only for reasons of legality and certification, but also to enable the development itself. At the same time, organizations are known to struggle to live up to traceability requirements, and there is

     Title RFID to improve traceability in continuous granular flows—An experimental case study
     Author ['B Kvarnström', 'B Bergquist', 'K Vännman']
     Venue Quality Engineering
     Year 2011
     Abstract Traceability is important for identifying the root causes of production-related quality problems. Traceability can often be reached by adding identification markers on products, but this is not a solution when the value of the individual product is much lower than the

     Title Improving traceability in continuous processes using flow simulations
     Author ['B Kvarnström', 'B Bergquist']
     Venue Production Planning & Control
     Year 2012
     Abstract Traceability is normally difficult to achieve in continuous processes, since there are no natural batch structures. In this article, we demonstrate flow-based simulation using process data to improve traceability in a continuous pelletising process. Using the simulation model

     Venue Food Control
     Year 2019
     Abstract Radio frequency identification (RFID) and quick response (QR) codes are an effective way to identify traceable resource units (TRUs) and are widely applied in traceability systems. TRU transformation is common for things such as beef segmentation and wheat-flour packaging
