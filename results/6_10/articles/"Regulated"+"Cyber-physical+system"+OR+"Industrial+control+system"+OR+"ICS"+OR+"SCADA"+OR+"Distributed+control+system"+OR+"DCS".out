     Year 2001
     Abstract qualitative and quantitative distinctions are regulated by inflammatory and microbial stimuli in a developmental process termed “maturation.” In effect, maturation couples innate to adaptive responses and is potentially pivotal in the self-nonself distinction orchestrated by DCs

     Title The Bcl-2-regulated apoptotic pathway
     Author ['S Willis', 'CL Day', 'MG Hinds', 'DCS Huang']
     Venue Journal of cell science
     Year 2003
     Abstract Mammals bear at least five homologs of pro-survival CED-9, namely Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1 and A1: all inhibit apoptosis during development and in response to cellular stress. They share with CED-9 at least three conserved BH (Bcl-2 homology) domains. Three of these
