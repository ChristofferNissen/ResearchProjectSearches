     Author ['E de Jong', 'R de Graff', 'P Vassen', 'P Crolla', 'A Roscoe']
     Venue NA
     Year 2012
     Abstract The alternative to hardware testing has traditionally always been software simulation. This has very strong advantages over a pure hardware simulation as it is very flexible and has typically only a fraction of the eco- nomical costs
