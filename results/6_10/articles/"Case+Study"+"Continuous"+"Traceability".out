     Title RFID to improve traceability in continuous granular flows—An experimental case study
     Author ['B Kvarnström', 'B Bergquist', 'K Vännman']
     Venue Quality Engineering
     Year 2011
     Abstract Traceability is important for identifying the root causes of production-related quality problems. Traceability can often be reached by adding identification markers on products, but this is not a solution when the value of the individual product is much lower than the

     Title High-warranty traceability system in the poultry meat supply chain: A medium-sized enterprise case study
     Author ['V Lavelli']
     Venue Food control
     Year 2013
     Abstract general, continuous food processes such as processing of liquid food leads to problems with indistinct lot separation. The concept of “fuzzy traceability” has been introduced to address this issue (Skoglund & Dejmek, 2007). Discontinuous food processes, such as the case-study
