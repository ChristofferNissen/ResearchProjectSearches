     Title An experimental evaluation of continuous testing during development
     Author ['D Saff', 'MD Ernst']
     Venue ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes
     Year 2004
     Abstract Continuous testing uses excess cycles on a developer's workstation to continuously run regression tests in the background, providing rapid feedback about test failures as source code is edited. It is intended to reduce the time and energy required to keep code well-tested

     Title Reducing wasted development time via continuous testing
     Author ['D Saff', 'MD Ernst']
     Venue 14th International Symposium on Software …
     Year 2003
     Abstract Testing is often performed frequently during development to ensure software reliability by catching regression errors quickly. However, stopping frequently to test also wastes time by holding up development progress. User studies on real development projects indicate that

     Title Taming Google-scale continuous testing
     Author ['A Memon', 'Z Gao', 'B Nguyen', 'S Dhanda']
     Venue 2017 IEEE/ACM 39th …
     Year 2017
     Abstract Growth in Google's code size and feature churn rate has seen increased reliance on continuous integration (CI) and testing to maintain quality. Even with enormous resources dedicated to testing, we are unable to regression test each code change individually

     Title Software testing and continuous quality improvement
     Author ['WE Lewis']
     Venue NA
     Year 2017
     Abstract It is often assumed that software testing is based on clearly defined requirements and software development standards. However, testing is typically performed against changing, and sometimes inaccurate, requirements. The third edition of a bestseller, Software Testing

     Title Testing continuous-time models of the spot interest rate
     Author ['Y Ait-Sahalia']
     Venue The review of financial studies
     Year 1996
     Abstract Different continuous-time models for interest rates coexist in the literature. We test parametric models by comparing their implied parametric density to the same density estimated nonparametrically. We do not replace the continuous-time model by discrete

     Title Testing for different rates of continuous trait evolution using likelihood
     Author ["BC O'Meara", 'C Ané', 'MJ Sanderson', 'PC Wainwright']
     Venue Evolution
     Year 2006
     Abstract Rates of phenotypic evolution have changed throughout the history of life, producing variation in levels of morphological, functional, and ecological diversity among groups. Testing for the presence of these rate shifts is a key component of evaluating hypotheses

     Venue Proceedings of the 22nd ACM …
     Year 2014
     Abstract In continuous integration development environments, software engineers frequently integrate new or changed code with the mainline codebase. This can reduce the amount of code rework that is needed as systems evolve and speed up development time. While

     Title Testing the constancy of regression parameters against continuous structural change
     Author ['CFJ Lin', 'T Teräsvirta']
     Venue Journal of econometrics
     Year 1994
     Abstract A standard explicit or implicit assumption underlying many parameter constancy tests in linear models is that there is a single structural break in the sample. In this paper that assumption is replaced by a more general one stating that the parameters of the model may
