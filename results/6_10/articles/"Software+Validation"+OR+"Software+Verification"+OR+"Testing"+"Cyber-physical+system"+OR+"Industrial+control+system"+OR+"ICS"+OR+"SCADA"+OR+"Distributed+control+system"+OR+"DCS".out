     Title Testing ICs: Getting to the core of the problem
     Author ['BT Murray', 'JP Hayes']
     Venue Computer
     Year 1996
     Abstract The article examines the market and technology trends affecting the testing of integrated circuits, with emphasis on the role of predesigned components-cores-and built in self test. We explain manufacturing testing, as opposed to design testing, which happens before

     Title Very-low-voltage testing for weak CMOS logic ICs
     Author ['H Hao', 'EJ McCluskey']
     Venue Proceedings of IEEE International Test …
     Year 1993
     Abstract In this paper we propose a very-low-voltage (VLV) testing technique for CMOS logic ICs. Voltage dependence of CMOS logic circuit operation in the presence of resistive shorts and hot carrier damage is studied. It is shown that at certain much-lower-than-normal power

     Title Testing TSV-based three-dimensional stacked ICs
     Author ['EJ Marinissen']
     Venue 2010 Design, Automation & Test in Europe …
     Year 2010
     Abstract To meet customer's product-quality expectations, each individual IC needs to be tested for manufacturing defects incurred during its many high-precision, and hence defect-prone manufacturing steps; these tests should be both effective and cost-efficient. The

     Title A gated clock scheme for low power scan testing of logic ICs or embedded cores
     Author ['Y Bonhomme', 'P Girard', 'L Guiller']
     Venue … 10th Asian Test …
     Year 2001
     Abstract Test power is now a big concern in large system-on-chip designs. In this paper, we present a novel approach for minimizing power consumption during scan testing of integrated circuits or embedded cores. The proposed low power technique is based on a gated clock scheme

     Title Assessing the organizational context for EBP implementation: the development and validity testing of the Implementation Climate Scale (ICS)
     Author ['MG Ehrhart', 'GA Aarons', 'LR Farahnak']
     Venue Implementation Science
     Year 2014
     Abstract Background Although the importance of the organizational environment for implementing evidence-based practices (EBP) has been widely recognized, there are limited options for measuring implementation climate in public sector health settings. The goal of this research

     Title Challenges and emerging solutions in testing TSV-based 2 1 over 2D-and 3D-stacked ICs
     Author ['EJ Marinissen']
     Venue 2012 Design, Automation & Test in Europe …
     Year 2012
     Abstract Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs) provide high-density, low-latency, and low-power vertical interconnects through a thinned-down wafer substrate, thereby enabling the creation of 2.5 D-and 3D-Stacked ICs. In 2.5 D-SICs, multiple dies are stacked side-by-side on top of a

     Venue DAC Design …
     Year 2012
     Abstract In this work, we present a robust small delay test scheme for through-silicon vias (TSVs) in a 3D IC. By changing the output inverter's threshold of a TSV in a testable oscillation ring structure, we can approximate the propagation delay across that TSV, and thereby detecting

     Title Test Generation for Current Testing (CMOS ICs)
     Author ['P Nigh', 'W Maly']
     Venue IEEE Design & Test of Computers
     Year 1990
     Abstract Current testing is useful for testing CMOS ICs because it can detect a large class of manufacturing defects, including defects that traditional stuck-at fault testing misses. The effectiveness of current testing can be enhanced if built-in current sensors are applied on

     Venue US Patent 5,491,426
     Year 1996
     Abstract An adaptable probe card assembly for testing an IC die includes a probe card and a decoupling apparatus selectably mounted on the probe card. A different decoupling apparatus is used for each IC die to be tested having a different power and ground bond pad

     Venue 1988 IEEE International Conference on …
     Year 1988
     Abstract In a typical approach to VLSI testing, open faults are modeled by the transistor-stuck-open fault model or are not explicitly covered at all. It is shown that functional faults caused by opens, ie by regions with missing material, cannot be modeled well by a transistor stuck
