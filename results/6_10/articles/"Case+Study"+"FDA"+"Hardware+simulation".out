     Author ['JP Jacquot', 'A Mashkoor']
     Venue NA
     Year 2018
     Abstract 3 https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/.../ucm085371.pdf 202 Page 3  As for the platooning case study, the kinematic functions are modeled with integers  We then need to bring the hardware simulation models up to the same abstraction level

     Title Computational challenges in structural and functional genomics
     Author ['T Head-Gordon', 'JC Wooley']
     Venue IBM Systems Journal
     Year 2001
     Abstract In cases where sequence identity dips below ~25 percent, the so-called "twilight zone," fold assignment algorithms can often be successful in determining the fold class for a new sequence (see Case Study 1)  The results of a typical HMM are illustrated in Case Study 2
