     Title A case study of IR-drop in structured at-speed testing
     Author ['J Saxena', 'KM Butler', 'VB Jayaram', 'S Kundu', 'NV Arvind']
     Venue null
     Year 2003
     Abstract At-speed test has become a requirement in IC technologies below 180 nm. Unfortunately, test mode switching activity and IR-drop present special challenges to the successful application of structural atspeed tests. In this paper we characterize these problems on

     Title Prospective case study design: qualitative method for deductive theory testing
     Author ['A Bitektine']
     Venue Organizational research methods
     Year 2008
     Abstract The article advances a prospective case study design in social sciences as an alternative to traditional post hoc case study research in deductive theory testing. It is argued that some limitations of post hoc qualitative methods in deductive theory testing can be alleviated by
