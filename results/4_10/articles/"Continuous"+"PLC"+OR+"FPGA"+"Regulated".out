     Title CAIR-1/BAG-3 forms an EGF-regulated ternary complex with phospholipase C-γ and Hsp70/Hsc70
     Author ['H Doong', 'J Price', 'YS Kim', 'C Gasbarre', 'J Probst']
     Venue Oncogene
     Year 2000
     Abstract CAIR-1/BAG-3 forms an EGF-regulated ternary complex with Hsp70/Hsc70 and latent phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ). The expression of CAIR-1, CAI stressed-1, was induced in A2058 human melanoma cells by continuous exposure to CAI, an inhibitor of nonvoltage-gated calcium
