     Abstract there is a smooth transition between the unsaturated to saturated region or vice versa, it is required that the function |λm|(|im|) ∈ C1, ie, continuous and with continuous first derivative. This will ensure that at the point |imc|, Lm(|imc|) = Ly(|imc|). For the FPGA implementation, (19
