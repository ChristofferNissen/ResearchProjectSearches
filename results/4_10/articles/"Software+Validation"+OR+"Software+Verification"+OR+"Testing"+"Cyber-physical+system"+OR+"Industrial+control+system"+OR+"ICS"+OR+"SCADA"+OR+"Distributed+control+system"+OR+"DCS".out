     Title Testing ICs: Getting to the core of the problem
     Author ['BT Murray', 'JP Hayes']
     Venue Computer
     Year 1996
     Abstract The article examines the market and technology trends affecting the testing of integrated circuits, with emphasis on the role of predesigned components-cores-and built in self test. We explain manufacturing testing, as opposed to design testing, which happens before

     Title Adaptable wafer probe assembly for testing ICs with different power/ground bond pad configurations
     Author ['GL Small']
     Venue US Patent 5,491,426
     Year 1996
     Abstract An adaptable probe card assembly for testing an IC die includes a probe card and a decoupling apparatus selectably mounted on the probe card. A different decoupling apparatus is used for each IC die to be tested having a different power and ground bond pad

     Title Test Generation for Current Testing (CMOS ICs)
     Author ['P Nigh', 'W Maly']
     Venue IEEE Design & Test of Computers
     Year 1990
     Abstract Current testing is useful for testing CMOS ICs because it can detect a large class of manufacturing defects, including defects that traditional stuck-at fault testing misses. The effectiveness of current testing can be enhanced if built-in current sensors are applied on

     Title High performance electron optical column for testing ICs with submicrometer design rules
     Author ['J Frosien', 'E Plies']
     Venue Microelectronic Engineering
     Year 1987
     Abstract An electron optical column has been developed, which is designed to meet the special requirements of electron beam testing for VLSI-ICs. With a spatial resolution of 0.1 μm at an electron acceleration voltage of 1 kV and a corresponding probe current of more than 2 nA

     Title Very-low-voltage testing for weak CMOS logic ICs
     Author ['H Hao', 'EJ McCluskey']
     Venue Proceedings of IEEE International Test …
     Year 1993
     Abstract In this paper we propose a very-low-voltage (VLV) testing technique for CMOS logic ICs. Voltage dependence of CMOS logic circuit operation in the presence of resistive shorts and hot carrier damage is studied. It is shown that at certain much-lower-than-normal power

     Title Testing oriented analysis of CMOS ICs with opens
     Author ['W Maly', 'PK Nag', 'P Nigh']
     Venue 1988 IEEE International Conference on …
     Year 1988
     Abstract In a typical approach to VLSI testing, open faults are modeled by the transistor-stuck-open fault model or are not explicitly covered at all. It is shown that functional faults caused by opens, ie by regions with missing material, cannot be modeled well by a transistor stuck

     Title Highly resilient cantilever spring probe for testing ICs
     Author ['P Mai']
     Venue US Patent 6,956,389
     Year 2005
     Abstract A probe has a cantilever arm coupled to a base via an anchor. A surface of the arm facing the base or a surface of the base facing the arm has steps with contact points that contact the base when the arm is depressed. Alternatively, the surface of the arm and/or the surface of

     Author ['CF Hawkins', 'JM Soden']
     Venue inte
     Year 1985
     Abstract This paper examines the electrical characteristics and testing considerations of gate oxide shorts. Gate oxide shorts will cause increased IDD and in the majority of cases will degrade logic voltage levels and propagation delay times, but may not affect functionality. Stuck-at
