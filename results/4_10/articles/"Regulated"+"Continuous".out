     Title The effects of regulated and continuous deficit irrigation on the water use, growth and yield of olive trees
     Author ['F Iniesta', 'L Testi', 'F Orgaz', 'FJ Villalobos']
     Venue European Journal of Agronomy
     Year 2009
     Abstract Important savings in the levels of irrigation without an associated penalty in yield have been reported for olive under deficit irrigation strategies. Full irrigation (C), continuous deficit irrigation (CDI) and regulated deficit irrigation (RDI), were compared from 2004 to 2006 in

     Title Flow-regulated continuous spinal drainage: technical note with case report
     Author ['SE Swanson', 'MJ Kocan', 'WF Chandler']
     Venue Neurosurgery
     Year 1981
     Abstract A new method for continuous external drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for the treatment of CSF fistulas is described. In this system, CSF is withdrawn continuously from the lumbar subarachnoid space at a controlled flow rate calculated to be slightly less than the natural
