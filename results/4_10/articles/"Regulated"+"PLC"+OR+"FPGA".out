     Title Dystrophin/α1-syntrophin scaffold regulated PLC/PKC-dependent store-operated calcium entry in myotubes
     Author ['J Sabourin', 'R Harisseh', 'T Harnois', 'C Magaud']
     Venue Cell calcium
     Year 2012
     Abstract In skeletal muscles from patient suffering of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and from mdx mice, the absence of the cytoskeleton protein dystrophin has been shown to be essential for maintaining a normal calcium influx. We showed that a TRPC store-dependent cation influx

     Title Identification of a novel cytosolic poly‐phosphoinositide‐specific phospholipase C (PLC‐86) as the major G‐protein‐regulated enzyme.
     Author ['GM Thomas', 'B Geny', 'S Cockcroft']
     Venue The EMBO Journal
     Year 1991
     Abstract Activation of phosphoinositide‐specific phospholipase C (PLC) generates two intracellular signals which play major roles in many cellular processes including secretion, proliferation and contraction. PLC activation by many receptors occurs via a guanine nucleotide

     Title Developmentally regulated instability of the GPI-PLC mRNA is dependent on a short-lived protein factor
     Author ['H Webb', 'R Burns', 'L Ellis', 'N Kimblin']
     Venue Nucleic acids …
     Year 2005
     Abstract The expression of the vast majority of protein coding genes in trypanosomes is regulated exclusively at the post-transcriptional level. Developmentally regulated mRNAs that vary in levels of expression have provided an insight into one mechanism of regulation; a decrease

     Venue Molecular biology of …
     Year 2011
     Abstract Transient receptor potential canonicals (TRPCs) play important roles in the regulation of intracellular calcium concentration. Mutations in the TRPC6 gene are found in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a proteinuric disease characterized by

     Title Pancreatic acini possess endothelin receptors whose internalization is regulated by PLC-activating agents
     Author ['P Hildebrand', 'JE Mrozinski Jr']
     Venue American Journal …
     Year 1993
     Abstract Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and ET-3 mRNA have been found in the pancreas. We investigated the ability of ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3 to interact with and alter dispersed rat pancreatic acinar cell function. Radiolabeled ETs bound in a time-and temperature-dependent fashion, which was

     Venue … et Biophysica Acta (BBA)-Molecular Cell …
     Year 1990
     Abstract Two isozymes of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C were isolated and purified from salt-washed rabbit brain membranes. The membranes were extensively washed with isotonic, hypertonic and hypotonic buffers prior to solubilization with sodium cholate. Two

     Title Regulated release of BDNF by cortical oligodendrocytes is mediated through metabotropic glutamate receptors and the PLC pathway
     Author ['IP Bagayogo', 'CF Dreyfus']
     Venue ASN neuro
     Year 2009
     Abstract A number of studies suggest that OLGs (oligodendrocytes), the myelinating cells of the central nervous system, are also a source of trophic molecules, such as neurotrophins that may influence survival of proximate neurons. What is less clear is how the release of these

     Venue Journal of cellular …
     Year 2013
     Abstract The brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) participates in the regulation of cortical neurons by influencing the release of glutamate. However, the specific mechanisms are unclear. Hence, we isolated and cultured the cortical neurons of Sprague Dawley rats
