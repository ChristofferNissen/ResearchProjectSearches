     Title Implementing a simple continuous speech recognition system on an FPGA
     Author ['SJ Melnikoff', 'SF Quigley']
     Venue Proceedings. 10th Annual …
     Year 2002
     Abstract Speech recognition is a computationally demanding task, particularly the stage which uses Viterbi decoding for converting pre-processed speech data into words or sub-word units. We present an FPGA implementations of the decoder based on continuous hidden Markov

     Title Enabling continuous planetary rover navigation through FPGA stereo and visual odometry
     Author ['TM Howard', 'A Morfopoulos', 'J Morrison']
     Venue 2012 IEEE …
     Year 2012
     Abstract Safe navigation under resource constraints is a key concern for autonomous planetary rovers operating on extraterrestrial bodies. Computational power in such applications is typically constrained by the radiation hardness and energy consumption requirements. For

     Title Speech recognition on an FPGA using discrete and continuous hidden Markov models
     Author ['SJ Melnikoff', 'MJ Russell']
     Venue International Conference on Field …
     Year 2002
     Abstract Speech recognition is a computationally demanding task, particularly the stage which uses Viterbi decoding for converting pre-processed speech data into words or sub-word units. Any device that can reduce the load on, for example, a PC's processor, is advantageous

     Title FPGA-based vibration analyzer for continuous CNC machinery monitoring with fused FFT-DWT signal processing
     Author ['J de Jesus Rangel-Magdaleno']
     Venue IEEE Transactions …
     Year 2010
     Abstract The industry of machine tools keeps a constant progress that responds to the most demanding market requirements, such as production-time decreasing and zero-defect manufacturing. As part of this progress, sensors and monitoring instruments have been

     Title Continuous production of hepatitis A virus in PLC/PRF/5 cell cultures: use of antigen for serology
     Author ['JM Crance', 'J Passagot', 'E Biziagos']
     Venue Journal of virological …
     Year 1987
     Abstract The strain CF53 of hepatitis A virus (HAV) previously adapted to growth in PLC/PRF/5 cells was grown in 175 cm 2 flasks, at different passages. After infection, cells were incubated at 32° C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2.5% foetal calf serum (FCS) for 6–12

     Title A linear time-over-threshold digitizing scheme and its 64-channel DAQ prototype design on FPGA for a continuous crystal PET detector
     Author ['W Yonggang', 'C Xinyi', 'L Deng']
     Venue IEEE Transactions on …
     Year 2014
     Abstract We propose a practical general method, called the linear time-over-threshold (linear TOT) scheme, for nuclear pulse amplitude digitization aiming at providing a high degree of integration for a high-channel count detector system. The most critical technique in the
