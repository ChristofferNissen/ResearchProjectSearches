     Title Dendritic cells: specialized and regulated antigen processing machines
     Author ['I Mellman', 'RM Steinman']
     Venue Cell
     Year 2001
     Abstract qualitative and quantitative distinctions are regulated by inflammatory and microbial stimuli in a developmental process termed “maturation.” In effect, maturation couples innate to adaptive responses and is potentially pivotal in the self-nonself distinction orchestrated by DCs
