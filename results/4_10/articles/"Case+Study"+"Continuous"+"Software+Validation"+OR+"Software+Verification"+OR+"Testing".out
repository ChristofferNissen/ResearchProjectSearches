     Title Test case prioritization for continuous regression testing: An industrial case study
     Author ['D Marijan', 'A Gotlieb', 'S Sen']
     Venue 2013 IEEE International …
     Year 2013
     Abstract Regression testing in continuous integration environment is bounded by tight time constraints. To satisfy time constraints and achieve testing goals, test cases must be efficiently ordered in execution. Prioritization techniques are commonly used to order test

     Year 2003
     Abstract wasted time by 4–41% in our case study. Changing the frequency with which tests are run can reduce wasted time by 31–82% (but developers cannot know the ideal fre- quency except after the fact). We introduce and evaluate a new technique, continuous testing, that uses
