     Title Continuous testing as a strategy of improving the PLC software development cycles
     Author ['U Kramer']
     Venue 2001 IEEE/ASME International Conference on …
     Year 2001
     Abstract An appropriate simulation environment for testing real-time software applications, especially PLC (programmable logic controller) programs, is in demand for many reasons. One of the them might be found in the altered conditions of cooperation (teamwork, teleworking, etc.)
