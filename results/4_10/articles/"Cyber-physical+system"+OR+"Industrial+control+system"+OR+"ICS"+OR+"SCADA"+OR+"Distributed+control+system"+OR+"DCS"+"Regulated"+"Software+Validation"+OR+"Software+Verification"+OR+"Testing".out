     Title Dendritic cell-derived IL-2 production is regulated by IL-15 in humans and in mice
     Author ['S Feau', 'V Facchinetti', 'F Granucci', 'S Citterio']
     Venue Blood
     Year 2005
     Abstract 3. Recently, we have demonstrated that mouse DCs can produce IL-2 after activation with different inflammatory stimuli. 4 The production of this cytokine is tightly regulated and is induced in a narrow timeframe after microbial and T-cell-mediated activation
