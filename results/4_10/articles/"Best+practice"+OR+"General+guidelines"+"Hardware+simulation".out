     Title Performance monitoring in a time-sharing system
     Author ['TB Pinkerton']
     Venue Communications of the ACM
     Year 1969
     Abstract Some general guidelines are offered for the construction of future monitoring programs  Another basic software tech- nique is that of hardware simulation [3]. The present facility, because it was carefully designed into the operat- ing system itself, provides information more

     Title European white book on real-time power hardware in the loop testing: Derlab report no. r-005.0
     Author ['E de Jong', 'R de Graff', 'P Vassen', 'P Crolla', 'A Roscoe']
     Venue NA
     Year 2012
     Abstract The alternative to hardware testing has traditionally always been software simulation. This has very strong advantages over a pure hardware simulation as it is very flexible and has typically only a fraction of the eco- nomical costs
