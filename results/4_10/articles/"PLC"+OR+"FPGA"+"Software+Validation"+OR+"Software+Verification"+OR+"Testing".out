     Title Application dependent FPGA testing method
     Author ['M Rozkovec', 'J Jenicek', 'O Novak']
     Venue 2010 13th Euromicro …
     Year 2010
     Abstract Application dependent FPGA testing can reduce time and memory requirements comparing with the tests that exercise complete FPGA structure. This paper describes a methodology of FPGA testing that does not require reconfiguration of the tested hardware and thus it
