     Abstract The data indicated that PC-PLC regulated apoptosis via integrin β 4 and P53 protein in VEC induced by rattlesnake venom. Integrin β 4 is found in hemidesmosomes in close proximity to molecules linking to the keratin filament system (Dowling et al., 1996)

     Abstract These observations are consistent with the possibility that an as yet unidentified species of PI-PLC regulated by Ras may play a role in mammalian cell proliferation, although they might be explained by accessory events accompanying the Ras-induced transformation such as

     Abstract We have indicated that TPA could promote PLC-γ2 translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus in a time-dependent manner, so it is interesting to figure out why PLC-γ2 is regulated (particularly its translocation) in response to TPA, and what the underlying functional implication is

     Abstract a mutation in the RA2 domain of PLC-ε that precludes activation by Ras fails to alter the stimulatory activity of Gβ 1 γ 2 . Although Gβγ is known to interact with certain PH domains, truncation mutants of PLC-ε lacking the PH and CDC25 domains retain Gβγ -regulated activity
