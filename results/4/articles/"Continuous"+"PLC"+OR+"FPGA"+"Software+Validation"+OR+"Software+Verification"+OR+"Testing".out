     Abstract Testing of a prototype in flotation columns was successful (Gomez et al., 1994; Tavera et al., 1996)  to deliver either of the conductivities, their ratio, or directly the gas holdup, which facilitates integration of the sensor to plant PLC systems. The unit provides a continuous signal
