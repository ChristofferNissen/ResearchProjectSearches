     Title Variables that influence results of impedance testing for valve regulated cells
     Author ['GJ Markle']
     Venue Proceedings of Intelec 93: 15th International …
     Year 1993
     Abstract This paper demonstrates the effects of two variables that influence measured internal cell impedance values: state-of-charge and temperature. Both influences have an inverse effect in that the internal impedance will decrease as the cell is subjected to proper float charging
