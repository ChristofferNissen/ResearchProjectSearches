     Author ['FH Fischer']
     Venue US Patent 6,347,387
     Year 2002
     Abstract A test device for testing inter-device connections of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAS) by using the FPGAs themselves during testing to form a shift register. Particularly, the shift register comprises flip-flops and buffers interconnected by the actual FPGA inter-device or

     Title Testing FPGA delay faults in the system environment is very different from" ordinary" delay fault testing
     Author ['A Krasniewski']
     Venue … Seventh International On-Line Testing …
     Year 2001
     Abstract Explains differences between testing delay faults in FPGAs and testing delay faults in circuits whose combinational sections can be represented as gate networks. Formulates-in a form suitable for analysis of LUT-based FPGAs-conditions that allow one to check whether or not

     Title An optimum ORA BIST for multiple fault FPGA look-up table testing
     Author ['A Alaghi', 'MS Yarandi', 'Z Navabi']
     Venue 2006 15th Asian Test …
     Year 2006
     Abstract This paper presents BIST architecture for FPGA look-up table testing using a minimum number of logic elements for its ORA. The propagation of faults in the TPGs and CUTs is formulated so that the ORA can detect multiple faults by monitoring a single signal. At the
