     Author ['SD Johnson']
     Venue Computer
     Year 2003
     Abstract the hardware simulation lan- guages superimpose synchronous dialects for verification and synthesis. Developers must apply the same methodology in embedded software design. Unfortunately, this will delay the deployment and diminish the effec- tiveness of formal methods
