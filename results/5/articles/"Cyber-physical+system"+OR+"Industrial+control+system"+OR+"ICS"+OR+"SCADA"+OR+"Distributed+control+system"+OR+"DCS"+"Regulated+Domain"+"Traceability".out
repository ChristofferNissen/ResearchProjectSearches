     Venue IEEE Transactions …
     Year 2019
     Abstract applications meet satisfactory safety standards. Our approach is meant to complement existing safety practices and could, for exam- ple, be used as part of a formal review process in a regulated domain. We propose a novel

     Author ['M Gleirscher', 'S Kugele']
     Venue arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.05537
     Year 2019
     Abstract Depending on the regulated domain, the engineering disci- pline, and the level of abstraction, an enhancement leading to a safety-enhanced design (Figure 1) is called “risk reduction measure” [IEC 61508], “safety function,” “safety measure,” “safety pat- tern” [Preschern et al
