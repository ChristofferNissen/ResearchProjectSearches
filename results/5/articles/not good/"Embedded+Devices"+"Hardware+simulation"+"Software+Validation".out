     Title On software simulation for mpsoc
     Author ['F Pétrot', 'P Gerin', 'MM Hamayun']
     Venue Design Technology for Heterogeneous …
     Year 2012
     Abstract instead of wire-driven FSMs, are currently in use for early software validation [4]. Although  this applies only to sophisticated OSes, they are now available for embedded devices as well  It is then possible to build hardware simulation models for execution units that implement this
