     Abstract Wildlife–vehicle collisions pose a major safety concern to motorists and can be a significant source of mortality for wildlife. Additionally, roadways can impede movements and reduce habitat connectivity. For migratory ungulates, these problems can be exacerbated when

     Abstract We consider the damped Newton's method N h (z)= z− hp (z)/p′(z), 0< h< 1 for polynomials p (z) with complex coefficients. For the usual Newton's method (h= 1) and polynomials p (z), it is known that the method may fail to converge to a root of p and rather leads to an attractive
