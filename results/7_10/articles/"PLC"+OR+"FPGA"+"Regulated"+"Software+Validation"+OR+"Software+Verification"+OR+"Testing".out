     Author ['S Subramanya', 'K Mensa‐Wilmot']
     Venue The FEBS journal
     Year 2006
     Abstract We conclude that: (a) GPI‐PLC contributes to loss of GPIs in T. brucei treated with hypo‐osmotic or mildly alkaline buffer; (b) access of GPI‐PLC to its substrate in vivo can be regulated post‐translationally; (c) translocation of GPI‐PLC from glycosomes to the ER is important for
