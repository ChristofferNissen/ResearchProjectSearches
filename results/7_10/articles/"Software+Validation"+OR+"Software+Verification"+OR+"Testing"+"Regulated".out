     Title AC impedance testing for valve regulated cells
     Author ['GJ Markle']
     Venue [Proceedings] Fourteenth International …
     Year 1992
     Abstract The author describes how the AC impedance of a valve regulated lead acid (VRLA) cell can be an indicator of the condition of the standby battery system. Used in conjunction with load cycle testing impedance testing identifies cells requiring replacement, reduces performance
